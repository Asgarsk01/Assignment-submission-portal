# Assignment Submission Portal

[The Assignment Submission Portal is a web-based application that simplifies the process of submitting and managing assignments. It provides a centralized platform for students to submit their assignments electronically, eliminating the need for physical paperwork. With features like file uploads, assignment tracking, and grading capabilities, the portal enhances the assignment submission experience for both students and instructors.

To ensure security and functionality, the portal integrates Firebase authentication for user login and Firebase storage for securely storing assignment PDF files. This enables authorized access and provides a reliable and scalable storage solution. By leveraging these technologies, the Assignment Submission Portal streamlines assignment management, improves communication, and enhances overall efficiency for educational institutions.]
